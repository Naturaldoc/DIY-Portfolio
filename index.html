							<p>Why not just use Tumblr, or Wordpress?</p>
							<p>.</p>
							<p>That's a good question, and I think that you should absolutely use Tumblr or Wordpress if</p>
							<p>you prefer how they look. They are also easier to use out of the box, no question.</p>
							<p>.</p>
							<p>But if you want a little more control, hate editing themes, or are just curious</p>
							<p>about learning some HTML, then DIY-Portfolio might be perfect for you.</p>

							<p>How does it work?</p>
							<p>.</p>
							<p>You can download the template from this Github link. The website is written</p>
							<p>in HTML and CSS, and I tried to keep it as simple as possible.  Once you have downloaded the</p>
							<p>template, that's it.  There are no more instructions.  Open up the files, and figure it out.</p>
							<p>.</p>
							<p>The code is optimized for readibility, and there are lots of comments to help you out.</p>
							<p>As you get stronger at HTML, you will notice little things here and there that could be improved.</p>
							<p>This is a good thing.</p>

							<p>Why did I make this?</p>

							<p>I made DIY-Portfolio as a template for my own website. Check it out as an example.</p>
							<p>.</p>
							<p>Why make another website template when there are already hundreds of options for things like this?</p>
							<p>.</p>
							<p>Good question.  I don't have an answer.</p>
							<p>I learned to code by hacking other people's code, hopefully you can do the same.</p>
