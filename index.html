					<p>Applying to college?  Or just need a simple website to showcase your work?</p>

					<p>How does it work?</p>
					<p>.</p>
					<p>You can download the template from <a href="https://github.com/kenamarit/DIY-Portfolio">this Github link.</a> The website is written 
					<p>with HTML, CSS, and Javascript/jQuery, and I've made everything</p>
					<p>as simple as it can be.  Once you have downloaded the template, that's it.</p>
					<p>There are no more instructions.  Open up the files in your text editor,</p>
					<p>and figure things out.</p>
					<p>.</p>
					<p>The code is optimized for readability, and there are lots of comments to help you out.</p>
					<p>As you get stronger at HTML, you will notice things that could be improved.</p>
					<p>This is a good sign.</p>

					<p>Why not just use Tumblr, or Wordpress?</p>
					<p>.</p>
					<p>That's a good question, and I think that you should absolutely use Tumblr or Wordpress if</p>
					<p>you prefer how they look. They are also easier to use out of the box, no question.</p>
					<p>.</p>
					<p>But if you want a little more control, hate editing themes, or are just curious</p>
					<p>about learning HTML, then DIY-Portfolio might be perfect for you.</p>

					<p>Check it out to see a working example.</p>
					<p>.</p>
					<p>Why re-invent the wheel and make yet another website template?</p>
					<p>.</p>
					<p>That's a legitimate question, and I don't have an answer.</p>
					<p>I learned to code by hacking other people's code. I only hope someone finds this useful.</p>
