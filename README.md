DIY-Portfolio
=============

A simple, open-source website template for makers who aren't afraid of a little bit of code.

=============

Feel free to dig in and change anything you like.  It is helpful if you already know a little bit of html.  If not, don't let
that discourage you--it may just take a bit longer to figure out.

All the instructions are comments in the code.  To change the background images, add files to the '/image' directory, and
you can link to them in the main.css file.
