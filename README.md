Save the whole directory to your computer and edit them with your favorite text editor.  Then, you can upload the whole directory to any number of online web hosts such as Blue Host, Namecheap, or Start Logic, just to name a few of the hundreds of companies that offer cheap hosting.

Feel free to dig in and change anything you like.  It is helpful if you already know a little bit of html and css.  If not, don't let that discourage you--it may just take a bit longer to figure things out.

That's it.  There are no more formal instructions, just comments in the code.

A quick note on background images:  To change the background images, add any files to the '/image' directory, and you can link to them in the main.css file.  You'll see the code for the images at the bottom of the file.
